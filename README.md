# Automatic Hippocampus Segmentation for Alzheimer's Disease Detection

## Project Overview

This project implements a multimodal deep learning framework for automatic hippocampus segmentation from 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans and simultaneous prediction of cognitive outcomes for Alzheimer's disease detection. The pipeline combines MRI volume data with clinical tabular metadata through a joint segmentation-regression learning paradigm.

## Research Contributions

### Our Original Contributions
   We design a good sampling subset that can represent the whole OASIS-1 dataset.
   We incorporate and evaluate the impact of multimodal data fusion from MRI volumes and tabular clinical metadata.
   We benchmark the performance of our approach against conventional single-task pipelines on both segmentation and regression metrics.The details are as follows:
1. **Novel Joint Learning Architecture**: 
   - Design and implementation of a multi-task framework that simultaneously performs hippocampus segmentation and cognitive score regression
   - Cross-task interaction mechanisms that allow segmentation and regression tasks to mutually enhance each other
   - Adaptive loss balancing strategy that dynamically adjusts task weights during training

2. **Multimodal Data Fusion Innovation**:
   - Integration of 3D MRI volumes with clinical tabular data (demographics, MMSE, CDR, brain volume measurements)
   - Four different fusion strategies: early fusion, intermediate fusion, late fusion, and attention-based fusion
   - Cross-modal attention mechanisms for effective multimodal feature learning

3. **Attention-Enhanced 3D U-Net**:
   - Implementation of CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for 3D medical images
   - Spatial and channel attention mechanisms specifically adapted for hippocampus segmentation
   - Attention-guided skip connections in the U-Net decoder

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**:
   - Progressive evaluation across four stages (A→B→C→D) showing incremental improvements
   - Clinical validation with correlation analysis between predictions and cognitive assessments
   - Uncertainty quantification for both segmentation and regression outputs

5. **Stratified Dataset Selection**:
   - Custom stratification strategy for OASIS-1 dataset ensuring balanced representation
   - Train/validation/test splits that maintain demographic and clinical balance
   - Data preprocessing pipeline optimized for joint learning tasks

6. **Advanced Training Strategies**:
   - Curriculum learning approach for joint multi-task training
   - Dynamic loss weighting based on relative task difficulty
   - Multi-scale loss functions for improved segmentation accuracy
