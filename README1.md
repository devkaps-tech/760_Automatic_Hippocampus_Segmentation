Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia, characterised by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline [1]. Neuropathological changes in AD are often reflected in brain structure – in particular, the hippocampus (a critical region for memory) undergoes measurable atrophy in early stages of the disease. Studies have shown that structural abnormalities of the hippocampus are associated with AD and other brain disorders. Therefore, precisely quantifying the hippocampal volume and shape is crucial for diagnosing and tracking disease progression. 

In this work, we develop a multimodal deep learning model for joint segmentation and regression in Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, we target the automatic segmentation of the hippocampus from 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans, and simultaneously predict a relevant continuous clinical outcome (such as a cognitive score) through a sibling regression branch. The proposed architecture processes two modalities of data: the MRI volumes and associated tabular data (e.g. demographic and cognitive test features) for each subject. We leverage the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) [4] dataset to train and evaluate our approach. OASIS-1 is a publicly available cross-sectional dataset of 416 individuals spanning ages 18 to 96, including 100 older adults clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate AD. Each subject in OASIS-1 has one or more T1-weighted MRI scans and accompanying clinical information – for example, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) are provided for the older participants. This rich dataset enables a truly multimodal learning scenario: the MRI inputs allow the model to learn anatomical details for segmentation. At the same time, the structured clinical features can inform the regression prediction.
We hypothesise that a multi-modal deep learning framework jointly trained on segmentation and regression will outperform single-task models in hippocampus delineation and cognitive score estimation. This is one of the few studies applying such a joint learning paradigm to the OASIS-1 dataset. Our contributions are threefold:
1.	We design a good sampling subset that can represent the whole OASIS-1 dataset.
2.	We incorporate and evaluate the impact of multimodal data fusion from MRI volumes and tabular clinical metadata.
3.	We benchmark the performance of our approach against conventional single-task pipelines on both segmentation and regression metrics.
